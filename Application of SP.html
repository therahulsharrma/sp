          <p>Markov chains can be designed to model many real-world processes, they are used in a wide variety of situations. These fields range from the mapping of animal life populations to search-engine algorithms, music composition and speech recognition. In economics and finance, they are often used to predict macroeconomic situations like market crashes and cycles between recession and expansion. Other areas of application include predicting asset and option prices, and calculating credit risks. When considering a continuous-time financial  market Markov chains are used to model the randomness. The price of an asset, for example, is set by a random factor – a stochastic discount factor – which is defined using a Markov chain.</p>

            In this article, we assume the security level of a system is a quantifiable metric and apply the insurance company ruin theory in assessing the defense failure frequencies. The current security level of an information system can be viewed as the initial insurer surplus; defense investment can be viewed as premium income resulting in an increase in the security level; cyberattack arrivals follow a Poisson process, and the impact of attacks is modeled as losses on the security level. The occurrence of cyber breach is modeled as a ruin event. We use this framework to determine optimal investment in cyber security that minimizes the total cyber costs. We show by numerical examples that there is an optimal allocation of total cyber security budget to (1) IT security maintenance/upkeep spending versus (2) external cyber risk transfer.

            This is an extension of the random amplitude-based improved Hilbert spectral representation method (IHSRM) that the authors developed 
            previously for the simulation of spatially correlated earthquake ground motions (SCEGMs) possessing the nonstationary characteristics
             of the natural earthquake record. In fact, depending on the fundamental types (random phase method and random amplitude method) and matrix 
             decomposition methods (Cholesky decomposition, root decomposition, and eigen decomposition), the IHSRM possesses various types.
              To evaluate the influence of different types of this method on the statistic errors, i.e., bias errors and stochastic errors, 
              an error assessment for this method was conducted. First, the random phase-based IHSRM was derived, 
              and its reliability was proven by theoretical deduction. Unified formulas were given for random phase- and 
              random amplitude-based IHSRMs, respectively. Then, the closed-form solutions of statistic errors of simulated 
              seismic motions were derived. The validness of the proposed closed-form solutions was proven by comparing the 
              closed-form solutions with estimated values. At last, the stochastic errors of covariance (i.e., variance and cross-covariance) 
              for different types of IHSRMs were compared, and the results showed that (1) the proposed IHSRM is not ergodic; (2)
               the random amplitude-based IHSRMs possessed higher stochastic errors of covariance than the random phase-based IHSRMs; and (3)  
               the value of the stochastic error of covariance for the random phase-based IHSRM is 
            dependent on the matrix decomposition method, while that for the random amplitude-based one is not.

            Insurance market and stock market are closely connected in many ways. Rational expectations models have been extensively used to study portfolio allocation and life insurance in equilibrium. (ese models assume that the agent possesses perfect knowledge about the probability law governing the stochastic asset return process. However, the true model is rarely known, so any specified probability law is subject to potential misspecification. Knightian uncertainty (henceforth, uncertainty) arises in the situation where the agent cannot develop a probability distribution to describe potential return misspecification. Stock returns are difficult to forecast and are prone to such uncertainty. We in the article formulate a continuous-time rational expectations model to examine the effects of stock return uncertainty on life insurance. (e model admits uncertainty aversion as the agent suspects that stock return in the stochastic process is potentially misspecified. We impose an uncertainty penalty to the agent’s objective function in reflecting his skeptical and conservative perspective. (ese years, many studies apply the model uncertainty to different models, for example, the stochastic interest rate , the insurer with reinsurance and investment problem , and the uncertainty about jump and diffusion risk. We find that optimal insurance demand increases with the level of uncertainty. (e agent shifts some of his investment in the stock to life insurance, confirming that the insurance market and the stock market, to some degree, substitute each other. Life insurance is used as a way to circumvent the uncertainty embedded in the stock. (is effect is more prominent for the middle-aged agent. Younger agent’s demand for life insurance is low in the first place. Elder agent consumes more, repressing demand for life insurance when it is close to the end of his financial planning horizon. As a result, the demand of younger and elder agents for life insurance is less sensitive to stock return uncertainty.

            Whenever we are constructing a financial model, we rely heavily on assumptions. Some, if not all, of those assumptions, have the associated uncertainty and inherent risk. Not being able to predict the future makes it harder to solve and model the probability of different outcomes from our financial models.In such situations, we can apply a Monte Carlo Simulation to analyze the effect of randomness introduced by such variables in our model.The simulation works by performing repetitive calculations using random inputs for these assumptions and then averages out the most probable output of the model.

            Markov chains refer to stochastic processes whose states change according to transition probabilities determined only by the states of the previous time step. They have been crucial for modeling large-scale systems with random behaviour in various fields such as control, communications, biology, optimization, and economics. In this entry, we focus on their recent application to the area of search engines, namely, the PageRank algorithm employed at Google, which provides a measure of importance for each page in the web. We present several researches carried out with control theoretic tools such as aggregation, distributed randomized algorithms, and PageRank optimization. Due to the large size of the web, computational issues are the underlying motivation of these studies.

            We investigate the DC pension manager’s portfolio problem when the manager is remunerated through two schemes for DC pension managerial compensation under loss aversion and minimum guarantee. We apply the concavification technique and a static Lagrangian technique to solve the problem and derive the closed-form representation of the optimal wealth and portfolio processes. Theoretical and numerical results show that the incentive schemes can significantly impact the distribution of the optimal terminal wealth.

          <p>When approaching Markov chains there are two different types; discrete-time Markov chains and continuous-time Markov chains. This means that we have one case where the changes happen at specific states and one where the changes are continuous. In our report we will mostly focus on discrete-time Markov chains. One example to explain the discrete-time Markov chain is the price of an asset where the value is registered only at the end of the day. The value of the Markov chain in discrete-time is called the state and in this case the state corresponds to the closing price. A continuous-time Markov chain changes at any time. This can be explained with any example where the measured events happens at a continuous time and lacks “steps” in its appearance. One well known example of continuous-time Markov chain is the poisson process, which is often practised in queuing theory.</p>

            Banking sectors have perpetual queues owing to the significance of the services they render to humanity and this poses a merging challenge of queue management in the execution their jobs and in the effective delivery of services to their customers. The study focuses on the role of queuing theory in the banking sectors thus far from pedigree of queuing theory till date. This study used the historical approach to juxtapose the likelihood of the impact of queuing in the various activities in the banking as seen in the regular applications to established areas of telecommunications systems and engineering. The outcome of this review espouses that a few approaches have been applied to sort the problems encountered in the banking sectors for needful improvement. Some of these approaches are ANN (Artificial Neural Network), BPR (Business Process Reengineering) M/M/1, M/G/1 and the Erlang B&C formulas for the management of excessive bank reserves and customer queues in terms of waiting times and economic cost. These approaches have been able to improve the performance of the banking sector to an extent, however there is still a couple of limitation regarded as external factors that varies from one banking system to another and lots of works are needed to further combat the problems faced by the banking sectors.
